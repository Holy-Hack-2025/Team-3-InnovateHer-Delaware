#Disadvantages: if you go really customed --> not the best choice. but a lot easier 
# API VS SDK 





# Anticipation is key to succes: flowchat for work, but there are a lot of things that can happen (error, how to use feedbackt to the customers, ...)
# Turn your api from a technical asset into a standout product 

# Logging: request comes in --> 1st you log the request, but you need a second log point --> 4 log points --> "4 ogen principe": you need to know where to log someting and at which points 
# who has accessed what data for which purpose and when? --> measure formats of the API 
# how many logs should you keep --> usually 3 months of logs --> very expensive databasis 
# Zalando APIs can help 
# working load: if you use an api during working hours eberything can go down. Your current user base's traffic patterns and frequency determine when and how heavility they load the system/ An upredictable or rapidly growng uer base can cause sudden spikes in API traffic.
